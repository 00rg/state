# Note: We delete all of the kube-prometheus ServiceMonitors that correspond to pods that are
# injected with the Istio sidecar. There is no need to define ServiceMonitors for these service
# as the general Istio PodMonitor will scrape their metrics. The ServiceMonitors that remain
# are for services that aren't injected - sometimes this is due to the pods being in the
# kube-system namespace which isn't injected by default and sometimes it's due to pods like
# the node exporter which share the host's network namespace and aren't injected. The other
# option is that we just provision all of the ServiceMonitors for the kube-system and
# grafana-stack namespaces and just disabled Istio sidecar injection for the entire
# grafana-stack namespace - we might go down this path but unsure of implications.

    # it uses the cert. The problem is that all published image versions of kube-webhook-certgen
    # use the v1beta1 API group of MutatingWebhookConfiguration rather than v1 which is now
    # standard. So disabling for now and will replace with cert-manager later.

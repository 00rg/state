* Naming Schemes

TODO: "production" should not be the name of an environment but rather a class of environment. Either that or "production" is an environment but there is the separate concept of an environment-target?

Accounts could be named numerically after their type/OU:
- workload-dev-01 + workload-prd-01
- workload-dev-02 + workload-prd-02
- sandbox-dev-01 + sandbox-prd-01
- shared-services-dev-01 + shared-services-dev-01
